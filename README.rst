The goal of this package is to provide easy-to-use tools for evaluation of the performance of segmentation methods in biomedical image analysis and beyond, and to fasciliate the comparison of different methods by providing standardized implementations. This package currently only supports 2-D image data.

The documentation is available here: https://segmetrics.readthedocs.io

Use ``python -m tests.all`` to run the test suite.
