segmetrics
==========

The goal of this package is to provide a low-threshold and standardized way of evaluating the performance of segmentation methods in biomedical image analysis and beyond, and to fasciliate the comparison of different methods. This package currently only supports 2-D image data, which may be extended to 3-D in the future.
